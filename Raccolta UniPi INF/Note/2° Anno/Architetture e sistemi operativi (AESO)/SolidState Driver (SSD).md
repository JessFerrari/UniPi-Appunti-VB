# Flash Storage

i dispositivi flash o detti a stato solido sono dispositivi per l immagazzinamento di grandi dati non hanno parti mobili  il che li rende meno vulnerabili permetto un random acces migliore

Each flash storage element is a floating gate transistor. As Figure 12.5 illustrates, an extra
gate in such a transistor “floats” — it is not connected to any circuit. Since the floating gate
is entirely surrounded by an insulator, it will hold an electrical charge for months or years
without requiring any power. Even though the floating gate is not electrically connected to
anything, it can be charged or discharged via electron tunneling by running a sufficiently
high-voltage current near it. The floating gate’s state of charge affects the transistor’s
threshold voltage for activation. Thus, the floating gate’s state can be detected by applying
an intermediate voltage to the transistor’s control gate that will only be sufficient to activate
the transistor if the floating gate is changed.
In single-level flash storage, the floating gate stores one bit (charge or not charged); in
multi-level flash storage, the floating gate stores multiple bits by storing one of several
different charge levels.
NOR flash storage is wired to allow individual words to be written and read. NOR flash
storage is useful for storing device firmware since it can be executed in place. NAND flash
storage is wired to allow reads and writes of a page at a time, where a page is typically 2
KB to 4 KB. NAND flash is denser than NOR flash, so NAND is used in the storage
systems we will consider
